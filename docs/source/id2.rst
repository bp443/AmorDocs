ID2 - Diagonalisation of dynamical matrix
==========================================

Multiple implementations are available. Implementations with ScaLAPACK and ELPA are using dense matrix diagonalisation, while future code will allow diagonalisation of sparse formats.

The :ref:`elpa` is available in the ``harmonic_properties_ELPA/dynmat_diagonalisation/diagonalisation_gamma`` folder, while the ScaLAPACK code is currently part of the PER3 code in the ``3_step_linewidth`` folder.
