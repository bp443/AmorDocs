Velocity Operator Calculation
=======================================

To calculate the velocity operator, you can use the in-house code which is based on BLAS. On AMD processors (Archer2, Sulis, Kelvin2) use `OpenBLAS` (or `Cray-LibSci` for Archer2), and on Intel CPUs, use MKL.

Requirements
-------------

Working BLAS library (e.g. OpenBLAS, MKL, Cray-LibSci)

How to use
-----------

1. Compile with the apropriate bash file
